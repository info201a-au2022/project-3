## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
library(tidyverse)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

summary_info <- list(ratio_between_needing_receiving, cases_adults_age_summarize,
                     deaths_by_country_summarize, ratio_between_cases_deaths, people_living_wHIV_summary,
                     ratio_of_needing_receiving)
Summary_info

```
The information summarized includes anti retro-viral therapy (ART) among children, prevalence of HIV among adults aged 15 to 49 in different countries, number of deaths due to HIV/AIDS, number of people living with HIV, number of pregnant women living with HIV who received anti retro-viral therapy for preventing mother-to-child transmission. More specifically we focus on six different values within these data sets. The first one is the ratio of children who need ART and those who have received it, being `r ratio_between_needing_receiving `. This shows the difference between the two, where there are many more people who need ART and only a small percent of children are actually receiving it. The second is the average cases of HIV/AIDS in adults across the world. The average is `r cases_adults_age_summarize `. The third value focuses on the average number of deaths across the world. The average number of deaths is `r deaths_by_country_summarize `. The fourth value is a combination of both the average cases in adults across the world and average deaths across the world. It is a ratio between the two which is `r ratio_between_cases_deaths`. The fifth value is the average of people living with HIV across the world. The average of people living with HIV is `r people_living_wHIV_summary`. The final value is `rratio_of_needing_receiving`. This represents the ratio of mothers receiving ART and those who are needing ART. Very similar to children receiving/needing ART, there is a huge difference. Where more mothers need ART but only a small portion is actually receiving it. This could have a huge effect on the transmission of HIV/AIDS to children being born.

frequencies_of_median_deaths_per_country <- deaths$Count_median

hist(frequencies_of_median_deaths_per_country)

```
=======
Instead of a focus on countries, I decided to show how the frequencies of the amount of median deaths per countries exists. It is interesting because it showed lower frequencies of more death rates.

```{r}
ggplot(HIV_AIDS_dataset, aes(x=as.factor(Country), y=Count_median)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill="slateblue", alpha=0.2) + 
  xlab("Country")
```
This chart represents the relationship between different countries and their respective median number of people living with HIV in their countries. It displays a ton of information and really shows where the outliers are in this dataset.

```{r}
<<<<<<< HEAD
mother_to_child <- read_csv("../data/prevention_mother_to_child.csv")
=======
mother_to_child <- read_csv("~/Documents/info201/project-group-4-section-ab/data/prevention_mother_to_child.csv")
>>>>>>> d56f70e4084a6cb297d30c767ce4a3f93d6c80c2

counts <- table(prevention_mother_to_child$`Received Antiretrovirals`)
barplot(counts, main = "Recieved Antiretrovirals",
        xlab = "Mother to Child Transmission Prevention")

```

This chart focuses on the prevention of mother to child transmission specifically pertaining to the number of recieved antiretrovirals for each country. It displayed really interesting disparities between the number recieved between the different countries.
