## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
deaths <- read_csv("~/Documents/info201/project-group-4-section-ab/data/no_of_deaths_by_country_clean.csv")

frequencies_of_median_deaths_per_country <- deaths$Count_median

hist(frequencies_of_median_deaths_per_country)

```
=======
Instead of a focus on countries, I decided to show how the frequencies of the amount of median deaths per countries exists. It is interesting because it showed lower frequencies of more death rates.

```{r}
ggplot(HIV_AIDS_dataset, aes(x=as.factor(Country), y=Count_median)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill="slateblue", alpha=0.2) + 
  xlab("Country")
```
This chart represents the relationship between different countries and their respective median number of people living with HIV in their countries. It displays a ton of information and really shows where the outliers are in this dataset.

```{r}
mother_to_child <- read_csv("~/Documents/info201/project-group-4-section-ab/data/prevention_mother_to_child.csv")

counts <- table(prevention_mother_to_child$`Received Antiretrovirals`)
barplot(counts, main = "Recieved Antiretrovirals",
        xlab = "Mother to Child Transmission Prevention")

```

This chart focuses on the prevention of mother to child transmission specifically pertaining to the number of recieved antiretrovirals for each country. It displayed really interesting disparities between the number recieved between the different countries.
