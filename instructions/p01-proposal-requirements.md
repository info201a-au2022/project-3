|Abstract |  Our main question is as follows: is there a correlation between the number of HIV/AIDS deaths and cases by country relating to pediatric coverage and prevention of mother to child transmission? This question is important because it brings out whether preventative public health measures by country have an impact on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. To address the question, we will examine datasets and disparities between multiple countries and see if there is a connection in the data given. We will see if there is a correlation between higher number of cases/deaths and lower preventative measures, or not after sorting through the data.

|Introduction | This project will examine the relationship between number of HIV/AIDS cases (adults 15-19) by country, number of deaths by country, number of people living with HIV by country, as well as contrasting it to prevention of mother to child transmission by country and pediatric coverage by country. We are looking to see if there is any correlation between these variables and overall see if different countries' public health measures can lead to less deaths/cases of HIV/AIDS. |
|Problem Domain | Through the analysis and collection of data on HIV/AIDS, we can determine correlations of cases that have been affected by the presence of lack of quality pediatric health coverage as well as the transmission of the disease from mother to child. Human Values: We take into consideration how the HIV/AIDS epidemic has had such an immense impact on individuals and families around the world and it continues to do so even as data on these diseases continue to emerge. Direct and Indirect Stakeholders: The direct stakeholders are people who have gathered and reported data on HIV/AIDS. This also includes individuals who have tested positive and reported the test. Indirect stakeholders are the individuals who created the website with information on it and the users of the website. This may or may not be direct to them because they are the ones who created the website, not the ones impacted by HIV themselves. Another indirect stakeholder is the medical personnel where a part of their job is to perform the HIV/AIDS test, to process the results, and to post them and notify the individual of their diagnosis. Potential Benefits and Harms: A possible harm that could be found are the discrepancies among reported data that may be unreliable or invalid. Having data that is wrong or data that has missing data leads to an inaccurate representation of these cases. Another potential harm is having information that is hard to interpret. Without this, those analyzing information may have a harder time avoiding bias to create the data sets. Some benefits involved are  bringing greater awareness to the HIV/AIDS epidemic as it is today in different countries across the world. Populations included: The populations included in the domain are 170 out of the total 195 countries. How this data exists: HIV diagnosis data exists because in order to estimate HIV prevalence in countries classified as having generalized epidemics, UNAIDS relies on antenatal clinic data and, to the extent that they are available, data from nationally representative HIV prevalence surveys. In order to estimate HIV prevalence in countries classified with concentrated and low-level epidemics, UNAIDS relies on specialized surveys of high-risk groups. The CDC uses a combination of methods to estimate HIV prevalence in the United States, including back-calculation (Brookmeyer, Ron). Preventative measures: The two data sets that focus on this are prevention of mother to child transmission by country and pediatric coverage by country. For pediatric coverage, it was shown in a study that BIPAI training program in Swaziland had good coverage of all health care facilities and HCPs in Swaziland. The training was effective in imparting knowledge and skills to HCPs and in their attitudes toward HIV/AIDS patients (Kamiru, H.N). And for prevention of child transmission, it is shown that “...in view of the enormous effect that this transmission route has on infant HIV-1 infection worldwide (Kourtis, Athena P, et al)”  So, mother-to-child transmission is super important and why we included it in as a data set.|
|Research Questions | What are ways to gather information on the correlation between cases, coverage, and maternal transmission with minimal bias or inaccuracy? This is important because the information collected on HIV/AIDS in correlation with those above can help with the understanding of the data. It then would be used apply coverage in areas of need, and how to act with them on a case by case basis which would be the motivations of collecting these variables of data How can information gathered on HIV/AIDS cases help us understand the relationship of public health in ways as how it differentiates between countries? This is important because the information gathered between the relationships through different countries may be used to implement more effective care in the place of those without it, due to the skew in data in such locations. Motivations for this would be to have all equal and accessible health care to all who need it, not just where they can afford to pay the luxury tax for it. How can data shown from stakeholders, which in this case are those who test positive, help us understand potential benefits or harms from treatments imposed such as ART (Anti-Viral Therapy)? This is important because the information collected from the stakeholders help identify potential benefits or harm which would be important for the future of the evolution of treatment. The motivation for this data being collected would be to evolve the study and with that help the potential of the ART therapy. How can we gain insights on the differences about the correlation of cases, coverages, transmission, preventative measures and how they each affect stakeholders accordingly? This is important because how they affect the stakeholders differently may help us understand the effects each variable has on the subject. Motivations for this would be to understand how each of this differently affect those affected by HIV/AIDS|
|The Dataset | The different data sets allow us to look at different areas relating to HIV/AIDS. First one allows us to visualize the number of people living with HIV/AIDS. The second one is the numbers of deaths due to HIV/AIDS. Third is the number of cases among adults ages 15-49. The fourth one is the number of pregnant women that are living with HIV who have received antiretrovirals. The fifth data set is reporting the ART coverages among people living with HIV. The final data set is reporting the ART coverages among children. The last two data sets are estimates. The first three data sets include country, year, count, median, min, max, and World Health Organization region. The fourth data set includes country, received antiretrovirals, needing antiretrovirals, percentage received, needing antiretrovirals median, needing antiretrovirals min, needing antiretrovirals max, percentage received median, percentage received min, percentage received max, and WHO region. The fifth data set includes country, reported no. of people receiving ART, estimated number of people living with HIV, estimated ART coverage among people living with HIV, estimated no. of people living with HIV median, estimated no. of people living with HIV min, estimated no. of people living with HIV max, estimated ART coverage among people living with HIV median, estimated ART coverage among people living with HIV min, estimated ART coverage among people living with HIV max, and WHO (World Health Organization) region. The final dataset is the same as the fifth one, but it  only focuses on children. These datasets will allow us to further understand and investigate an answer for our question since it focuses on multiple factors relating to HIV/AIDS. Such as cases, children, people receiving treatment, and pregnant women with AIDS. Devakumar K. P. who is a student at NIELIT Calicut, put together the data sets. The collection method for the data is a GitHub page. Sources for data is the World Health Organization. Purpose is unknown but we can assume that it was created for research purposes. For others to have access to HIV/AIDS data that has been summarized. People who are likely to make money from the data are the creators and potential collaborators. The temporal coverage start date is January, 9th, 2000 and the end date is December, 25th, 2018. The datasets are said to be updated annually but it has not been updated in two years. Even though it has not been updated in two years it is still a very credible source. Since the data has been collected from the World Health Organization which is a government agency that is responsible for international public health.![alt text](project-group-4-section-ab/dataset.png)|
|Expected Implications | If we come to the conclusion that there is in fact a correlation between numbers of deaths caused by HIV/AIDS along with case count by country relating to pediatric coverage and prevention of mother to child transmission, then technologists will be able to update data on HIV/AIDS. Possibly creating new data to present as well. Hospitals will have to make changes to the care of HIV/AIDS patients. An example could be the type of medication they are receiving. This will also include scientists, who will create or make changes to said medications. Medications will hopefully lead to a decrease in children who are born with HIV/AIDS. In making new discoveries about HIV/AIDS it leads to a world wide change in new measures and changes. Policy makers could create policies towards ending the spread of HIV/AIDS. As long as the population is aware and more cautious, the creation of policies can go a long way to decrease the number.|
