|Abstract | Our main question is: is there a correlation between number of HIV/AIDS deaths and cases by country relating to pediatric coverage and prevention of mother to child transmission? This question is important because it brings out whether preventative public health measures by country have an impact on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. To address the question, we will examine datasets and disparities between multiple countries and see if there is a connection in the data given.

|Introduction | This project will examine the relationship between number of HIV/AIDS cases (adults 15-19) by country, number of deaths by country, number of people living with HIV by country, as well as contrasting it to prevention of mother to child transmission by country and pediatric coverage by country. We are looking to see if there is any correlation between these variables and overall see if different countries' public health measures can lead to less deaths/cases of HIV/AIDS.
 |
|Problem Domain | By analyzing and gathering data on HIV/AIDS we can determine correlations of cases that have been affected by pediatric coverage and mother to child transmission. We take into consideration how much HIV/AIDS has had an effect on individuals and families around the world and as it continues to do so. Direct stakeholders are people who have gathered and reported data on HIV/AIDS. As well as individuals who tested positive and reported the test. Other stakeholders are people who created the website with information on it and the users of the website. Possible harms are reporting data that is unreliable or invalid. Another potential harm is having information that is hard to interpret. Having data that is wrong or having missing data leads to inaccurate representation of cases. Avoiding bias to create the data sets. Benefits are having visual experiences that are easy to understand. Also, determining the correlation of variables. Another benefit is bringing awareness to the issue of HIV/AIDS around the world.

|Expected Implications |  If we come to the conclusion that there is a correlation between numbers of  HIV/AIDS deaths and cases by country relating to pediatric coverage and prevention of mother to child transmission then technologists will be able to update data on HIV/AIDS. Possibly creating new data to present as well. Hospitals will have to make changes to the care of HIV/AIDS patients. An example could be the type of medication they are receiving.  |
|Limitations | One limitation is missing information or inaccurate information. We have to work with the data that has been collected and make inferences. Another limitation is working with lots of data. We have to correctly represent data without it being confusing or too much information.
